### Navigation bar
1. Add padding between the list items in the navigation bar by declaring a new style and adding the "padding" property to look something like
    
    {% filename %}styles.css{% endfilename %}
    ```css
    nav li {
        padding: 2px;
    }
    ```
    {% hint style='tip' %}
`padding: 2px;` means add 2px of padding on all 4 sides of the element. It's the same as 
```css
padding-top: 2px;
padding-right: 2px;
padding-bottom: 2px;
padding-left: 2px;
```
    {% endhint %}
1. To make the navigation list items display horizontally, add `display: inline;` to the style;
1. Add padding between the hyperlinks in the navigation bar. We already have a style declared for this `a` tag so add the padding property there. We want 6px on the top and bottom, but 20px on the right and left. 

    {% hint style='info' %}
We can use shorthand properties to help by defining all 4 sides on the same property like this `padding: 6px 20px`. 

Refer to [MDN documentation for shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties).
    {% endhint %}

1. Remove all space around the navigation bar unordered list group by setting margin and padding to 0.
    {% hint style='tip' %}
This is the `nav ul` style.
    {% endhint %}
1. Set `display:` to `inline-block;` to ensure everything stays on the same horizontal line. 

### Drink menu
1. Remove the margin and padding from the `div` where `class="drinks"` by setting margin and padding to 0.
1. We want each menu item to display like a block element so add `display: block;`.
1. The dotted top border line between the list items in the drinks menu is too close to the image. Add a 10px top padding above each image in the style declaration for drink list items.
1. The drink list items need a little breathing room. Add a 60px bottom margin between each drink list item.
    {% hint style='working' %}
Why use margin instead of padding? Refer to the box model image in the CSS Cheat Sheet. Notice the difference where space gets added. You can see for yourself by opening Chrome Dev Tools, adding a bottom border and bottom padding in the **Styles** tab, and watching where space gets added. The styles you add in Dev Tools won't save. Mentors are here to help.

    {% endhint %}
1. The images in the drinks menu needs horizontal spacing by setting `margin: 0 20px;`.

### Footer
1. Remove all space around the footer unordered list group by setting margin and padding to 0.
1. Using "display" property, we want the social icons in the footer to also display horizontally like you did for the navigation. Add `display: block;` to the style you already have for the unordered list in footer. 
1. Add a style to each list item in the footer to ensure everything stays on the same horizontal line.
    {% hint style='working' %}

<summary>

</summary>
Declare a style for the `li` tag within `footer` and add `display: inline-block;` 
</details>
   {% endhint %}
1. The social icons now extend pass the background color. Give the social icons a little extra space by setting the `footer` height to 75px;
