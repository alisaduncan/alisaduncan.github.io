## Part 2: Getting Sassy

You've had some practice with basic CSS, now let's move on to practicing styling a page using Sass to make life a bit easier. 

####Why are we using Sass?

There are some things that can be cumbersome in plain CSS, and you can feel like youâ€™re repeating yourself a lot. Using a pre-processor to write your styles can ease these pain points. A compiler will take these pre-processed styles & compile them into plain CSS. The syntax of pre-processors is similar to CSS and pre-processors are going to be used by most employers today. We chose Sass over some of the other pre-processors options because it is the most popular choice so you will run into Sass more often than the others.

###The Project

If you follow our instructions your page will end up looking like the example below but feel free to add in some of your own creativity if you feel comfortable!
