# Project

We'll start out trying some basic CSS styling in Part 1 to get some practice and learn how to make the page look better.  From there we'll start trying out Sass - a CSS Compiler - to work through styling a sample page more efficiently.  We’ll utilize Sass variables, mixins and nesting to make our development easier!
