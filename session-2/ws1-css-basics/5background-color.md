1. Select a background color for the entire page and add it to _styles.css_ by using the `body` selector and "background-color" property at the top of the file. 
    {% hint style='tip' %}
The `body` is the parent element for the website so setting a style here applies to every element within **unless** it's overridden. Organize your CSS by setting global styles at the top of the file and target styles for specific elements after global styles. Declare styles for specific elements in vertical order as it appears in the HTML to make it easy to find later.
    {% endhint %}

1. Select a background color for the Small plates menu. Notice in _index.html_ the Small plates menu `div` has a `class="sidebar"`. Create a style for this class after your styles for drinks and set the background color. 
1. To help make the navigation and footer area pop, select a background color to use. Look at the _index.html_ file to identify the selectors for the navigation and footer sections. Be sure to declare the style for the navigation bar near the top of _styles.css_ file and footer style at the bottom of the file.
