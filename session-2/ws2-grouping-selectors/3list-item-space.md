1. Open _index.html_ and find "Small plates" so that you know how to target styles to this list. Notice this section uses 3 classes, one of which is `class="sidebar"`. We will target this class for styling. 
1. First remove the bullet points. Last time we targeted `ul` in the HTML elements `nav` and `footer`, but this time target `ul` in `class="sidebar"`. 
    {% hint style='tip' %}
Remember, styles for `class` has `.` prepended. Take a look at your fine work resizing the drink menu images. 
    {% endhint %}
1. We want to add extra space between each list item on the "Small plates" menu by setting the "margin-top" property to "50px" on the list items. Create a style targeting `li` within the `ul` with `class="sidebar"`.
1. Save your file and reload in Chrome. You now have plenty of spacing between each food menu item but the "margin-top" property also added space between the "Small plates" header and list. Let's take care of that extra space next.
1. Create another style targeting the `li` elements in the "Small plates" menu after the one you created in the previous step. Add the Pseudo Class "first-child" and define the "margin-top" property using the value "0". We are overriding the previous style selectively for the first child. Your code should look like this
    
    {% filename %}styles.css{% endfilename %}
    ```css
    .sidebar ul li:first-child {
        margin-top: 0;
    }
    ```
    Save your file and refresh the page. The spacing looks better now. 
    {% hint style='info' %}
You can also use combinators to declare a property on all `li` except the first one using combinators. You could have written 
```css
.sidebar ul li + li {
    margin-top: 50px;
}
```

The `+` is the Adjacent sibiling combinator and selects `li` elements directly after the first one. Read more about the [Adjacent sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors).
