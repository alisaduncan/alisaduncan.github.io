1. Select a default color for the headers. Create a style for all headers (`h1` - `h6`) and define the "color" property in _styles.css_. Since this is a default style, define it near the top of the page, after the style for `body`.
    {% hint style='tip' %}
Define a style for more than 1 selector by comma separating the selector list. 
    {% endhint %}
    Save and refresh your page. Do you see your default color applied?
